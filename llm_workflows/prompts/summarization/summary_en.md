Produce a concise summary (max. 200 words) in English.

## Processing
- Fix ASR issues silently; ignore filler words.
- Focus on central topics and facts; omit small talk and repetition.
- Mention each fact once; aggressively deduplicate.

## Style
- Use third person only, neutral register, present tense.
- No quotes, no direct speech, no subjective judgments.
- For unclear references, insert placeholders such as `[PERSON]` or `[PLACE]`.

## Output
Single paragraph, no heading, start directly with the content.
